                When I was a kid, I had the passion of finding solutions to every problems and analyzing things. 
                I used to be the one who they approach whenever there's an issue with something needed to get fixed. 
                I loved the challenge of taking things apart and putting them back all together and I'd always enjoyed doing it.

                Now, I can apply the same approach I learned whenever I program, code, and build web/software applications especially when there a problem arising (eg. bugs, errors, inaccuracy, etc). 
                I also learned to organize my way to make things easier, usable and efficient in the long run - applying software engineering principles I learned throughout the years of experience in coding.

And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision." - James Clear
